## Features

- [#] Indentifiers scope and storage
- [#] Runtime types
- [_] Function definition
- [#] Function call
- [_] Conditional structures
- [_] Boolean types
- [_] Expression operations
- [_] Iteration expression
- ... more will be unlocked once I now which ones are. Like, I don't know what I don't know.
