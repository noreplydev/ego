#### ego is an interpreted, dynamically typed programming language written in rust. It is currently under development and many features still need to be built such as expression execution, conditional and iteration structures, etc.

## Features

- [#] Indentifiers scope and storage
- [#] Runtime types
- [_] Function definition
- [#] Function call
- [_] Conditional structures
- [#] Boolean types
- [_] Binary operators
- [_] Expression parsing and return value calculation
- [_] Iteration structures
- ... more will be unlocked once I now which ones are. Like, I don't know what I don't know.
