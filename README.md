# Hello world
ego is an interpreted, dynamically typed programming language. To start writting ego the interpreter must be compilled locally using cargo. So you would need to clone the repo and create a build for your targeted OS. 

After that, you will only need to create a .ego file like this: 

```ego
// ./hello_world.ego

print("Hello world"); 
```

And that's it, you can run ego with a simple
```ego
$ ego hello_world.ego
```
